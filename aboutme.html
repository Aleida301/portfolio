    <h1> About me </h1>
    <p> I was born on thursday, March 1st, 2001 to Angelica and Demetrio. I was born in the small beach town of Santa Cruz.
	  Throughout my childhodd I switched between living in Mexico and living in California because my parents wanted 
	  me to understand both cultures. I have been living here permanently since 6th grade. Currently I am an upcoming 
	  junior at Harbor High. I live with my grandparents which is nice because thye are very understanding. I am
	  interested into studying a STEM career in college but I haven't decided what to study.

    <p> Reflection June 20: Based on what I learned today some similarities are 
	    the loops and the simple way you can make the program do anything. 
	    Some differences are the was you make something repeat. For example,
	    in scratch you could simply use a block that said repeat x number of
	    times and in python you have to say range. The main difference is 
	    having to write out everything yourself. I didn't ejoy working on 
	    python as much as I would've expected. I think it had to do with the
	    fact that my computer wasn't working very well and python is picky 
	    about syntax. Also many of the commands on python wouldn't work so 
	    my partner and I weren't able to get much done. I'm still working to 
	    debug my website so I will be able to make it look better. 
	  </p>
	  
    <p> Reflection June 23: A list is a set of terms grouped under one name. This 
	    is helpful for organization or to be able to pick things from a 
	    category. It is also helpful if you want to pick only certian values
	    a list that have certain traits. I liked working with everyone in my 
	    table because it allowed me to hear different ideas but at the same
	    time I felt pressured to contribute even if I didn't understand anything.
	    Python has been very hard for me. I can't seem to memorize or understand
	    simple concepts so doing simple things like addition and or multiplication
	    is very hard for me. I didn't really enjoy python that much. I liked the 
	    last project because I did it with other poepe and I was able to figure
	    it out since my partners kew what they were doing.

	  <p> Reflection June 26: Today made me think about how important it is to know how robots actually work and that there is much more to them than just k
	  </p>
	  <p>Reflection June 29: Today I was able to work with my team and make a robot play a song am=nd make the LED turn on to the beat of the music. I was also able to attach whisker wires to the robot and program it so when the whicsker wires would hit a surface the robot would turn. incluse pic********
